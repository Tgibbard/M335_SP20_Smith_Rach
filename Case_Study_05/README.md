 # Notes on Tidy Data by Hadley Wichham

80% of data analysis is the process of cleaning and preparing the data.

Data Tidying: Structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

melting- stacking data: makes longer rows and more columns.

Messy data when variables are stored in rows and columns

filter- removes observations based on conditions
transform- adding or modifying variables
aggregate- collapsing multiple values into a single value
sort- changes order of operations.

ggplot(data = devi, aes( x = n, y = dist) + geom_point()

last_plat() +
scale_x_log10() +
scale_y_log10() +
geom_smooth (method = "rlm", se = F)

4 Ingredients to make an awesome business analyst:

1. Layout a framework on paper before looking/creating your datsets. 
  * 1-2 hours of distraction free time.
  * layout the structure
        * hypothesis, story flow, tenative presentation.
        
2. Use whiteboards for brainstorming (BEFORE touching the data):
  * call stakeholders and layout discussion
      * ensure engagement and good brainstorming.
      
3. Practise back of envelope calculations:
    *perform calculations in your head and not on paper.
    * layout the structure in your mind, THEN come up with answers.
    
4. Use a note/document to conduct meetings/discussions:
    * create a note with problem & solution before discussions.
