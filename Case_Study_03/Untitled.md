## Background

#### Give Your Visualization Wings to Fly

You just started your internship at a big firm in New York, and your manager gave you an extensive file of flights that departed JFK, LGA, or EWR in 2013. Your manager wants you to answer the following questions using data from in nycflights::flights:

1. If I am leaving before noon, which two airlines do you recommend at each airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) that will have the lowest delay time at the 75th percentile?

2. Which origin airport is best to minimize my chances of a late arrival when I am using Delta Airlines?

3. Which destination airport is the worst (you decide on the metric for worst) airport for arrival time?
