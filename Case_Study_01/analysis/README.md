Find 4-5 examples of data-driven answers and write a one-paragraph review of each, including 2-3 good/unique qualities and 1 issue with each.

### Example 1
#### !nternet Boy Band Database
*https://pudding.cool/2018/11/boy-bands/*

You're Welcome.

Wow. Just. Wow.  My kids were laughing so hard when I found this database.  I'm not particularly a huge fan of boy bands, even if my high school soundtrack has some BSB and N*SYNC songs, but I still watched the entire thing. 

I was blown away by the creativity that went into creating this database.  I am very impressed with level of detail in the characted animations, dance moves, and the amount of time it must have taken to complete.  I think the only issue, that feels unfair to even point out because of the detail, but I think rather than a skip option, and pause, it would be amazing to have the option to speed it up because it deserves to be watched all the way through. 

### Example 2
#### The Most (and Least) Obese States in America
*https://priceonomics.com/the-states-with-the-worst-eating-and-exercise/*

The above chart is a very bland chart that I had a hard time connecting with it.  The chart focuses on one topic, including the percentages next the the bar helps clarify the slight differences between the results. I also like that it shows all 50 states.  

One thing I didn't like is that I also had to do math in my head in order to find a significant statistic.  I wonder if instead of using solid lines, it would be better to use simple 10 people icons with different colors showing the percentage of people that are obese.  This would remind me that this statistic is about people and show a lot faster that there are nearly 2x as many obese people in Virginia as Colorado.  

### Example 3
#### Total confirmed COVID-19 cases, Apr 23 2020
*https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cases-covid-19?tab=map&year=2020-04-23*

This chart is a very effective, interesting, and eye catching way to show the speed of the spread of COVID-19.  The red color creates a sense of increased urgency and danger as the red darkens. The speed is effective at showing how out of control the spread of the virus is.  The first half moves very slowly and the last half moves so quickly it's hard to pay attention to any individual country.  I think an issue with this chart is that the main focus is the spreed of the spread, but the data is also supposed to help you understand the number of cases.  

An issue that I see with this chart, is that when you click on an individual country and push the "play" symbol, the visualization is simply a bar graph that is very innefective and feels unneccessary.  The plotted graph that shows is a much more effective way to show the growth. 

### Example 4
#### The U.S. hasn't turned the corner yet
*https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-cases-are-still-growing-in-many-u-s-states/*

I think my favorite part about this chart is the bright colors and the simple square shapes that are layed out in the shape of the U.S., artistically, this chart speaks to me.   However, while I was drawn to the colors and the style, the chart is not done very well.  The text in the legend is very long and unclear, and overall I'm not sure what the significance or the colors or the chart is. 

### Example 5
#### Most Wanted Cars Nationally
*https://priceonomics.com/the-most-wanted-cars-in-america/*

I felt like this chart is very clear and easy to understand, with good labels and headings.  I like that they used photos of the actual vehicle.  I am not a "car" person, and this helped me to be able to recognize the type of car that was ranked.  The headings very clear and added some interest without too much data.  There were two things that could be improved or left me confused.  First, I'm wondering if the car colors they posted the actual color that is most desired.  Second, at first glance I thought these were the most purchased cars in America while in fact it's just the most searched on carmax, and not car sales.
